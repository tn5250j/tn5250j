tn5250j README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an implementation of the 5250 telnet protocol in java.  I started it
because I could not find a 5250 emulator of Linux with the enhanced functions
like graphical windows, cursor progression, continued edit fields, masked edit
fields etc.....

Socket Security
---------------
TN5250J supports SSL socket connections using SSL version 1, SSL version 2, or
TLS.  Right now, the SSL type is configured on the client, but automatic type
discovery will be supported in a future version.

During SSL handshaking, a custom Trust Manager is used to validate the server's
certificate.  If the certificate can not be trusted by default Trust Managers,
(typically when keys have not been signed by a proper CA), then the user will
be prompted to accept the certificate.

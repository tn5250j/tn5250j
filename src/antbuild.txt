Ant build README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have only tested this with ant build 1.4.1 so do not know if it is backwards
compatible with previous versions.

Steps to get started after setting up ant
-----------------------------------------
1. Create a base directory to place source
2. Create two directories beneath the base directory called lib and src

for example your directory structure should look like the following:

base directory
   |
   + - lib
   |
   + - src

3. Unzip and place all source files from tn5250j source zip file that was
   downloaded into src directory.  This includes the Meta-inf directory.
4. Place the included build.xml file into the base directory.
5. Place the extra .jar files used for mailing in the lib directory.
   *** NOTE *** this is very important or some modules will not compile

   You can download the e-mail api's from sun.  You will need two packages.
      http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/
      http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html

   JavaMail jar files
   ------------------
   activation.jar
   mail.jar
   mailapi.jar
   smtp.jar

6. Now execute ant using one of the methods described in the ant documentation.

   using the sample bat file for windows below:

   c:\basedirectory>build all


   Sample Windows build.bat that I use on windows
   ----------------------------------------------
@echo off

rem this batch-file can be used to override the java_home or ant_home
rem environment or to set a special classpath and so on...
set ANT_HOME=D:\jakarta-ant-1.4.1
set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.3.1

call %ANT_HOME%\bin\ant -buildfile build.xml %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
